# STEDI Human Balance Analytics Lakehouse Project

## Introduction
In this project, we build a data lakehouse solution for the STEDI team using their sensor data that trains a machine learning model. The STEDI team wants to use the motion sensor data to train a machine learning model to detect steps accurately in real-time.  Yet, not all of the early adoptors have agree to share their data for research purposes. Since privacy is of a primary consideration for the company, one of the first tasks is to ensure that data of only these customers who agree to share their Step Trainer and accelerometer data is be used in the training data for the machine learning model.
