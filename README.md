# STEDI Human Balance Analytics Lakehouse Project

## Introduction
In this project, we build a data lakehouse solution for the STEDI team using their sensor data to train a machine learning model. The STEDI team wants to use the motion sensor data to train a machine learning model to detect steps accurately in real-time. Yet, not all of the early adopters have agreed to share their data for research purposes. Since privacy is a primary consideration for the company, one of the first tasks is to ensure that data from only those customers who agree to share their Step Trainer and accelerometer data is used in the training data for the machine learning model.
